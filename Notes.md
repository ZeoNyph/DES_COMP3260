# NOTES

This file outlines the initial development of COMP3260 A2.

## Stuff to work on

- I/O handling (file parsing, arguments, printing output)
- DES F function (do for 16 rounds):
    - Expansion permutation
    - XOR with round key
    - S boxes
    - Permutation P
- IP (Initial Permutation) and its inverse
- Input padding (if needed)
- Parity bit selection (every 8th bit)
- Avalanche Effect (key and plaintext)
- Decryption
